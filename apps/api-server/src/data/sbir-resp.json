                "topic_description": "Purpose\n\nNINDS is committed to advancing treatments, tools, and diagnostics that benefit people burdened by neurological diseases through the NINDS Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.\n\nThe development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the Valley of Death). To achieve commercialization, some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable grant-in-aid financing beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve follow-on investment or commercialization. In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.\n\nIn addition, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development. Many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically disparate patient populations.\n\nFor the purposes of this NOFO, NINDS has defined small markets as development of novel products that:\n\nAddress a rare disease as defined in the Orphan Drug Act Amendment of 1984 as any disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States\nQualify as a Humanitarian Use Device, defined as a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 persons in the United States per year\nTarget a young pediatric population defined as including neonates (0-28 days), infants (<2 years), and/or children (2-12 years of age), as indicated in the FDA Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices.\nAre tools intended for the neuroscience research market\nThe goal of this NOFO is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH\u2019s SBIR/STTR recipients  and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. In particular, this NOFO will give competitive preference and funding priority to applications deemed likely to result in a commercial product as indicated by an applicant's ability to secure partnerships within a broad range of potential third-parties.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nIndependent Third-Party Partners\n\nThis NOFO is specifically intended to encourage business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products and technologies initiated with NIH SBIR or STTR funding. In particular, applicants are expected to leverage their previous NIH SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NINDS funding under this NOFO, to negotiate and attract third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant\u2019s ability to secure funds will provide a measure of commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR applications submitted to this NOFO. This commercial potential will be strongly considered in making funding decisions. It is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party partners will involve a considerable level of project due diligence, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. Third-party partners include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an \u201cangel\u201d investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a state or local government, or any combination of the above. In light of these goals, the NINDS strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in the commercialization of emerging biomedical technologies.\n\nNINDS expects companies working in small markets (as defined above) to secure independent third-party funding equal to or greater than one-third of the NINDS funds being requested throughout the project period. For all other projects, it is expected that the level of this independent third-party funding will be equal to or greater than the NINDS funds being requested throughout the Phase IIB Bridge Award project period.\n\nScientific/Technical Scope\n\nThis NOFO is specifically designed to provide additional support for products/technologies that require ultimate approval by a Federal regulatory agency or complex research tools. Such products include, but are not limited to:\n\nTherapeutics or diagnostics that require FDA approval, including medical implants, drugs, biologics, biomarkers, and new treatment or diagnostic tools.\nComplex research tools.\nClinical research tools: Such tools would include those that are developed for clinical research use that do not require any federal regulatory approval, but still require extensive development in order to demonstrate validity.\nThe technical and commercial o...",

The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.\n\nThe development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the Valley of Death). To achieve commercialization, some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable grant-in-aid financing beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve follow-on investment or commercialization. In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.\n\nIn addition, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development. Many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically disparate patient populations.\n\nFor the purposes of this NOFO, NINDS has defined small markets as development of novel products that:\n\nAddress a rare disease as defined in the Orphan Drug Act Amendment of 1984 as any disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States\nQualify as a Humanitarian Use Device, defined as a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 persons in the United States per year\nTarget a young pediatric population defined as including neonates (0-28 days), infants (<2 years), and/or children (2-12 years of age), as indicated in the FDA Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices.\nAre tools intended for the neuroscience research market\nThe goal of this NOFO is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH\u2019s SBIR/STTR recipients  and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. In particular, this NOFO will give competitive preference and funding priority to applications deemed likely to result in a commercial product as indicated by an applicant's ability to secure partnerships within a broad range of potential third-parties.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nIndependent Third-Party Partners\n\nThis NOFO is specifically intended to encourage business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products and technologies initiated with NIH SBIR or STTR funding. In particular, applicants are expected to leverage their previous NIH SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NINDS funding under this NOFO, to negotiate and attract third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant\u2019s ability to secure funds will provide a measure of commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR applications submitted to this NOFO. This commercial potential will be strongly considered in making funding decisions. It is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party partners will involve a considerable level of project due diligence, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. Third-party partners include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an \u201cangel\u201d investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a state or local government, or any combination of the above. In light of these goals, the NINDS strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate prior experience in the commercialization of emerging biomedical technologies.\n\nNINDS expects companies working in small markets (as defined above) to secure independent third-party funding equal to or greater than one-third of the NINDS funds being requested throughout the project period. For all other projects, it is expected that the level of this independent third-party funding will be equal to or greater than the NINDS funds being requested throughout the Phase IIB Bridge Award project period.\n\nScientific/Technical Scope\n\nThis NOFO is specifically designed to provide additional support for products/technologies that require ultimate approval by a Federal regulatory agency or complex research tools. Such products include, but are not limited to:\n\nTherapeutics or diagnostics that require FDA approval, including medical implants, drugs, biologics, biomarkers, and new treatment or diagnostic tools.\nComplex research tools.\nClinical research tools: Such tools would include those that are developed for clinical research use that do not require any federal regulatory approval, but still require extensive development in order to demonstrate validity.\nThe technical and commercial o...",

                "topic_description": "Purpose\r\n\r\nNINDS is committed to advancing treatments, tools, and diagnostics that benefit people burdened by neurological diseases through the NINDS Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. The main objective in SBIR/STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development (R&D) efforts, whereas in SBIR/STTR Phase II it is to continue the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business concern (SBC) will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds in Phase III.\r\n\r\nThe development of medical biotechnology products is often impeded by a significant funding gap (known as the Valley of Death). To achieve commercialization, some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable grant-in-aid financing beyond the SBIR/STTR Phase II award to achieve follow-on investment or commercialization. In particular, the development of regulated products such as therapeutics and medical devices often requires several years and substantial capital investments, due in part to the high costs of clinical trials.\r\n\r\nThis NOFO supports applications from Small Business Concerns (SBCs) for exploratory clinical trials or studies that contribute to the justification for a future trial to establish definitive efficacy (such as a Phase 3 clinical trial or a Pivotal device trial). This includes Phase 1 and 2 studies of drugs and biologics, feasibility and preliminary efficacy studies of devices, first-in-human studies (as defined by the Food and Drug Administration), as well as early studies of surgical, behavioral or rehabilitation therapies. This NOFO supports single-site and multi-site trials with up to three clinical sites. Applications must aim to generate data that inform further clinical development of the proposed intervention or diagnostic, and in the case of FDA-regulated clinical trials applications must demonstrate readiness by including FDA approval of the proposed study. The earliest clinical studies should be designed to provide important initial information regarding the intervention (e.g., safety, tolerability, dosing) or diagnostic. Mid-stage clinical studies will generally include randomization and blinding and should yield data that allow a clear go/no-go decision regarding whether the intervention should proceed to an efficacy trial. All applications must outline specific plans for future development in the event of promising results.\r\n\r\nIn addition, NINDS recognizes that companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or that target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive to investors and strategic partners at preclinical or early clinical stages of development. Many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically disparate patient populations.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this NOFO, NINDS has defined small markets as development of novel products that:\r\n\r\nAddress a rare disease as defined in the Orphan Drug Act Amendment of 1984 as any disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States\r\nQualify as a Humanitarian Use Device, defined as a medical device intended to benefit patients in the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 persons in the United States per year\r\nTarget a young pediatric population defined as including neonates (0-28 days), infants (<2 years), and/or children (2-12 years of age), as indicated in the FDA Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices.\r\nAre tools intended for the neuroscience research market\r\nThe goal of this NOFO is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product/technology that requires Federal regulatory approval or to bring a complex research tool to market. To achieve this goal, the NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of previously funded SBIR or STTR Phase II projects to the commercialization stage by encouraging business relationships between NIH\u2019s SBIR/STTR recipients  and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. In particular, this NOFO will give competitive preference and funding priority to applications deemed likely to result in a commercial product as indicated by an applicant's ability to secure partnerships within a broad range of potential third-parties.\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives\r\n\r\nIndependent Third-Party Partners\r\n\r\nThis NOFO is specifically intended to encourage business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide substantial financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products and technologies initiated with NIH SBIR or STTR funding. In particular, applicants are expected to leverage their previous NIH SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NINDS funding under this NOFO, to negotiate and attract third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant\u2019s ability to secure funds will provide a measure of commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR applications submitted to this NOFO. This commercial potential will be strongly considered in making funding decisions. It is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party partners will involve a considerable level of project due diligence, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. Third-party partners include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an \u201cangel\u201d investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a state or local government, or any co...",

                "topic_description": "Since its inception in 1982, the NIH SBIR program has provided the small business community with seed funding to support the development of a broad array of commercial products to detect, diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. It provides an important funding mechanism for bringing new interventions to patients and clinicians. The SBIR program is structured in three phases. The objective in Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of a proposed research and development (R&D) effort, while in Phase II it is to continue the R&D effort for successful Phase I projects. The expectation is that in Phase III, a Small Business Concern (SBC) will be able to launch a product commercially with non-SBIR funds. However, many projects initiated with SBIR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR Phase II award to complete the validation studies required to obtain regulatory approval and launch a product. In particular, the development of therapeutics, medical devices, and combined technologies often requires a number of years and substantial capital investments because of the costs associated with conducting clinical trials and/or other steps mandated by the Federal regulatory approval process. Companies developing products that have small potential revenue streams or target small patient populations face additional barriers to market entry that make them less attractive at preclinical or early clinical stages of development to investors and strategic partners. In addition, many of these technologies require complex clinical trial designs because of small and geographically diverse patient populations. Thus, despite the extensive R&D performed on such products during Phase II projects, the results are often insufficient to attract the substantial private investment needed for the eventual commercialization of the product. Many small businesses therefore become cash-starved before reaching the next critical milestone along the path toward commercialization. Hence, this NOFO is designed to address this funding gap between the end of the SBIR or STTR Phase II award and the point at which non-SBIR financing can be secured for the subsequent stages of product development. A number of public and private organizations recognize the challenges associated with this funding gap and are taking steps to provide additional resources to advance a greater number of promising early-stage technologies toward commercialization. Importantly, many of these organizations are not only providing financial support but are also establishing programs to provide commercialization guidance. For example, in the area of drug development, a number of major pharmaceutical firms have developed corporate venture funds focused on supporting projects in the preclinical stages of development, and some of these firms have established technology incubators to provide development support, including regulatory guidance. In addition, a growing number of universities are creating venture funds to support innovative technologies developed by their resident investigators, and numerous state-sponsored technology funds have also been created across the U.S. to support start-up companies. In the rare disease area, patient advocacy groups and foundations have organized to accelerate progress in the development of treatments for their disease. Such programs can provide additional financing and commercialization support for SBIR awardees that have received initial seed funding and a rigorous technical evaluation through the NIH peer review process. As such, a major goal of this NOFO is to provide a platform to incentivize partnerships between NIH-funded SBIR awardees and a broad range of potential third-party investors. It is anticipated that funding by third-party investors will be predicated on significant due diligence, thus encouraging awardees to formulate credible business plans for product commercialization. In addition, it is expected that third-party investors will maintain an active role in supporting the awardee during the product development phase and during pursuit of follow-on funding for commercialization.\n\nSpecific Objectives for SBIR Phase IIB Small Market Award Applications\nA. Independent Third-Party Investor Funds\n\nThis NOFO specifically encourages business relationships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors/strategic partners who can provide financing to help accelerate the commercialization of promising new products whose development was initiated with SBIR or STTR funding. Applicants are expected to leverage their previous SBIR or STTR support, as well as the opportunity to compete for additional NHLBI funding under this NOFO, to attract and negotiate third-party financing needed to advance a product or technology toward commercialization. The applicant\u2019s ability to secure independent third-party investor funds that equal or exceed one-third of the total amount of the NHLBI funds being requested over the entire Phase IIB Small Market Award project period will help to validate the commercial potential that is essential for the SBIR projects proposed under this NOFO. This potential will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. If a Phase IIB Small Market Award application is selected for funding, the applicant\u2019s plan for securing independent third-party investor funds (i.e., the Finance Plan submitted as part of the application) will become a term of award as described in Section VI.1 Award Notices. It is anticipated that many of the partnerships between applicant SBCs and third-party investors will involve a considerable level of project due diligence by the private sector, thereby increasing the likelihood of commercial success for the funded projects. In light of these goals, the NHLBI strongly encourages applicants to establish business relationships with investors and/or strategic partners that have appropriate ...",

Applicants seeking a Phase IIB renewal must have received an eligible predicate award that is appropriate and relevant (e.g., pre-clinical studies, planning activities, etc.) to this NOFO.\r\n\r\nAlthough clinical trials not considered high-risk (see NOT-AI-21-037) may be proposed, this program encourages high-risk clinical studies. High-risk does not imply human subject or patient risk, but rather defines a study that contains one or more of the following unique attributes: involves non-routine interventions, administration of an unlicensed product, or administration of a licensed product for an unapproved indication. Additionally, mechanistic studies are encouraged and can be proposed under this program. Applicants may not propose more than one clinical trial per application.\r\n\r\nBackground      \r\nOver the past three years, NIAID has committed over $5.5 billion to clinical research, of which $2.5 billion was devoted to clinical trials and supportive activities. Clinical trials are one research strategy NIAID uses to improve the understanding of the clinical mechanisms of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases or to improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. For additional information about the mission, strategic plan, and research interests of the NIAID, applicants are encouraged to consult the NIAID website https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/role.\r\n\r\nNIAID Supported Clinical Trials and Infrastructure\r\n\r\nHistorically, NIAID supports both infrastructure and networks through a variety of funding mechanisms. These resources focus on high-priority disease research areas. Examples include the HIV/AIDS Clinical Trial Networks supported by the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium, and the Immune Tolerance Network supported by the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT). NIAID's clinical research infrastructure includes coordinating centers, statistical units, data centers, central laboratories, clinical centers, and other specialized resources. For additional information on DAIDS supported clinical trials refer to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Clinical Research Policies and Standard Procedures Documents. For additional information on DAIT Clinical Research Policies and Documents see: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/dait-clinical-research-policies-and-standards.\r\n\r\nInvestigator-Initiated Clinical Trials\r\n\r\nAlthough existing clinical trial programs and infrastructure are crucial to furthering the Institute's research, the NIAID recognizes that additional means to support clinical research may be important to advancing its research mission. Therefore, the NIAID has established the investigator-initiated clinical trial program for clinical trials that cannot or will not be conducted through existing NIAID-supported clinical trial networks or infrastructure.\r\n\r\nFor additional information about NIAID's investigator-initiated clinical trial program, see https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/investigator-initiated-clinical-trial-resources.\r\n\r\nScope\r\nThe NIAID SBIR Phase II Clinical Trial Implementation Cooperative Agreement (U44) program provides a unique and focused opportunity for small business concerns (SBCs) interested in conducting clinical trials. This NOFO supports implementation of clinical trials from small business concerns (SBCs) that propose clinical trials in research areas that are well-matched with the mission and goals of the NIAID. The proposed clinical trial should be hypothesis-driven and milestone-driven.\r\n\r\nA clinical trial is defined by NIH as: \"A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.\" See more at: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html#sthash.W5hQ9GMA.dpuf\r\n\r\nIn addition, any research study that will require a regulatory oversight (such as Investigational New Drug [IND] or Investigational Device Exemption [IDE]) will be in the scope of this NOFO.\r\n\r\nAll clinical trial planning activities must be completed prior to the time of application submission and all requested documentation needs to be provided for an application to be considered complete for a Phase II award (except for Fast Track applications).\r\n\r\nInvestigators are referred to NIAID's Clinical Research Toolkit website for protocol templates and guidance, clinical research resources, and links to program divisions. Investigators are strongly encouraged to contact the NIAID Scientific/Research Contact(s) for information regarding division-specific clinical research policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nThis NOFO will support the conduct, completion, and analysis of a clinical trial, including activities related to the conduct of the clinical trial, which include but are not limited to the following:\r\n\r\ntraining of study personnel;\r\nenrollment and recruitment of study subjects;\r\ninvestigational product costs;\r\ndata collection, management and quality control;\r\nlaboratory work and data analyses;\r\nstudy management and oversight;\r\nsafety monitoring and oversight;\r\nestablishment of committees to manage the complexity of the trial;\r\npreparation of the final study report; and other related post-trial activities;\r\nregulatory activities and site monitoring can be covered if required; and\r\nm...",

                "topic_description": "Purpose\n\nThis Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant applications from small business concerns (SBCs) that propose to implement investigator-initiated clinical trials related to the research mission of the NEI. This program provides support for milestone-driven, commercialization-oriented clinical trials and will involve participation of NEI program staff in negotiating the final project plan before award and monitoring of research progress. Applications supported by this NOFO must meet the NIH definition of a clinical trial (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-015.html) and must be greater than minimal risk trials. As defined in 45 CFR \u00a7 46.102, a minimal risk trial is one in which the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.\n\nThe mission of the NEI is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. Applications considered for funding by the NEI must align with the NEI Strategic Plan.\n\nBackground\n\nThis NEI SBIR Cooperative Agreement (U44) for Clinical Trials is designed to support SBIR grant applications specifically from small business concerns (SBCs).  Currently, the NEI uses U01 cooperative agreement mechanism https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-22-149.html to support early-stage, small-scale clinical trials that are greater than minimal risk; and UG1 https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-041.html to support large-scale, multi-center clinical trials, human gene-transfer and stem cell therapy trials, and other complex or high resource- or safety-risk clinical trials.\n\nScope\n\nThe scope of this NOFO is to support U44 applications for clinical trials to investigate the safety and/or efficacy of screening, diagnostic, preventative, or therapeutic interventions for eye diseases or disorders. Applicants seeking a Phase II or Phase IIB award must have received an eligible predicate award that is appropriate and relevant (e.g., pre-clinical studies, planning activities, etc.) to this NOFO. An application without an eligible predicate award must be submitted as a Direct to Phase II application. This NOFO is specifically intended for early-stage clinical trials with greater than minimal risk that meet all of the following criteria:\n\nInclude strong preliminary and/or pre-clinical data\nAre early-stage clinical trials\nHave a well described Commercialization Plan (see Section IV for details)\nExamples of appropriate studies include, but are not limited to, those designed to:\n\nEvaluate and optimize the dose, formulation, safety, tolerability, or pharmacokinetics of an intervention in healthy volunteers or the target population.\nEvaluate whether an intervention produces sufficient evidence of short-term activity (e.g., biomarker activity, target engagement, dose-response trends, pharmacodynamic response) in a human \u201cproof of concept\u201d trial.\nSelect or rank the best of two or more potential interventions or dosing regimens to be evaluated in a subsequent trial, based on tolerability, biological activity, or preliminary clinical efficacy.\nDetermining the optimal outcome measure (endpoint), its variability, and/or the optimal timing of outcome evaluations in the context of the intervention.\nEstablish proof-of-principle and optimize techniques, operation, and usability of a device, inform the final device design decisions, and estimate the magnitude of treatment effects.\nCollecting information on the utility of questionnaires, rating scales, or biomarkers.\nThis NOFO will support the conduct, completion, and analysis of a clinical trial, including activities related to the conduct of the clinical trial, which include but are not limited to the following:\n\ntraining of study personnel\nenrollment and recruitment of study subjects\ninvestigational product costs\ndata collection, management and quality control\nlaboratory work and data analyses\nstudy management and oversight\nestablishment of committees to manage the complexity of the trial\npreparation of the final study report and other related post-trial activities\nregulatory activities and site monitoring can be covered if required\nClinical trial planning activities should be completed prior to the time of application submission and investigators must be ready to implement the proposed trial at the time of award. If the proposed clinical trial involves the use of a drug or a device that has not been approved by the FDA for the proposed investigational use, then evidence of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application submission to the FDA that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 312 is required at the time of the U44 grant application submission. It is the responsibility of the applicant to provide evidence from the FDA if an IND or an IDE is not required. NEI reserves the right to deny or postpone the award until evidence of IND/IDE authorization from FDA is provided.\n\nMilestones\n\nDelineation of milestones is a key characteristic of the NEI Cooperative Agreement (U44) for Early-Stage Clinical Trials with greater than Minimal Risk. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity. See Section IV. Application and Submission Information for more specific instructions.\n\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO:\n\nThe following types of activities remain outside of the scope of this NOFO, and applications proposing such activities will be considered non-responsive to this NOFO and will be withdrawn without review:\n\nApplications that do not meet NEI Mission: https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning\nApplications involving a clinical experiment that is not directly intended to evaluat...",

To be considered innovative, projects must have the potential to transform the way research is conducted through the development of novel tools or technologies or lead to major improvements in pediatric and rare cancer care through the development of highly innovative therapies, diagnostic tools, or preventive strategies. Projects that primarily focus on optimization, hardening, or obvious extrapolations of established technology might be less competitive. For example, the following types of projects would not be considered innovative and would not be responsive:\n\u2022 Therapeutics targeting genes and pathways with FDA-approved agents or agents in late clinical stage unless the novel approach mitigates known issues with approved agents\n\u2022 Screening, diagnostic, and monitoring approaches already in clinical use\n\u2022 Continuation of already funded SBIR/STTR projects\nProposals are encouraged for the development of innovative approaches focused on detection, prevention, and treatment of pediatric or rare cancers. The solicitation is agnostic to the type of technologies and modalities as long as they are highly innovative and reflect ideas substantially improved from current state of the art. Projects supported by this program should not be low risk, or incremental improvements to established technologies. These could include but not limited to novel therapeutics and prevention approaches, therapeutic devices, drug delivery approaches, and devices focused on early diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response.\nProposals are solicited for all innovative ideas \u2013 not limited to the ones above \u2013 if they are focused on detection, prevention, and treatment of pediatric cancers or rare cancers. Projects are anticipated to have a high risk of failure with concomitant high reward. Commercial potential is evaluated by assuming the continued development of technology is successful, regardless of the inherent risk of the project.\nThe awards will support initial exploration of untested but potentially transformative ideas that may radically change the way we understand, prevent, diagnose, treat, and manage rare or pediatric cancers. These Concept Awards are intended to provide funds to perform key de-risking activities to demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility and lay the groundwork for future Federal funding opportunities. Concept awards are not intended to support continuation of already established and advanced research programs. Thus, preliminary data is not required; however, the ideas should have sound scientific premise either based on the offeror\u2019s own research or literature evidence. These awards are focused on development of innovative products and technologies; thus, the anticipated product that will be developed should be identified and a development path should be clearly laid out.\nIn addition to funds provided to demonstrate technical proof-of-concept, the program will integrate customer discovery and entrepreneurial training to ensure that awardees develop an appropriate business model, market fit, and commercialization plan. As such, the awardees are expected to go through the NIH I-CorpsTM (see section 2.3) program. Concept Awardees will also receive entrepreneurial mentorship to help them refine their business model and commercialization plan.\nActivities and deliverables proposed by the offerors would differ based on their technology types and stage of development. However, the offerors should ensure that they clearly identify the clinical problem and cancer type(s) that the proposal will focus on with adequate justification.

The products should be able to engage users for interactive learning experiences. They are expected to not only disseminate knowledge of biomedical science, but also enhance student's interest in learning more about biomedical science and related research, and to develop and strengthen student's problem-solving skills. IDM that develops students' quantitative and computational skills is particularly encouraged. The products may be designed for inside or outside of classroom use, for students individually or in a group setting, with or without teacher or adult participation or supervision. Features that allow real-time student assessment are strongly encouraged. While products serving all age or grade groups of pre-college students and their teachers in instructional roles are allowed, each product must be age, grade and culturally appropriate for its target audience, and developed on IDM platforms that are accessible to the target learner level.\n\nSee Section VIII.

National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) support small businesses through the SBIR and STTR programs to develop promising technologies and products that align with their mission to improve health and save lives.\n\nAs described by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the statutory purpose of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is to strengthen the role of innovative small business concerns (SBCs) in federally-funded research or research and development. The purpose of the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and technologies between innovative SBCs and non-profit Research Institutions. Federal agencies with extramural research budgets over $100 million are required to set-aside 3.2% of their extramural research budget to the SBIR program, and those with extramural research budgets over $1 billion are required to set aside an additional 0.45% to the STTR program.\n\nPurpose\n\nThis Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) issued by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) invites eligible United States small business concerns (SBCs) to submit Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I, Phase II, Direct to Phase II (NIH Only), Fast-Track (NIH only), and Phase IIB (NIH only) grant applications. Small business applicants interested in submitting an STTR grant application should submit to PA-24-247 or PAR-24-248.\n\nSBIR and STTR are phased programs. The main objective in SBIR and STTR Phase I is to establish the technical merit and feasibility of the proposed research and development efforts. An SBIR and STTR Phase II continues the R&D efforts to advance the technology toward ultimate commercialization. At the conclusion of an SBIR/STTR Phase II, it is expected that the small business will fully commercialize their product or technology using non-SBIR/STTR funds (either federal or non-federal). Small businesses that are eligible to submit Phase II applications for projects that were supported with a Phase I SBIR or STTR award are expected to submit the regular Phase II application as a \"Renewal\" application based on the awarded Phase I SBIR or STTR project. Only one Phase II application may be awarded for a specific project supported by a Phase I award.\n\nNIH Fast-Track: An NIH SBIR Fast-Track incorporates a submission and review process in which both Phase I and Phase II applications are submitted and reviewed together as one application to reduce or eliminate the funding gap between phases.\n\nNIH Direct to Phase II: For small businesses that have already demonstrated scientific and technical merit and feasibility but have not received a Phase I SBIR or STTR for that project, NIH can issue a Direct to Phase II award. The NIH will accept Direct to Phase II applications regardless of the funding source for the proof of principle work on which the proposed Phase II research is based. Direct to Phase II awards should be submitted as \u201cNew\u201d applications and not continuations (\"Renewal\") of Phase I SBIR or STTR projects.\n\nNIH Phase IIB: Some projects initiated with SBIR or STTR funding require considerable financing beyond the SBIR and STTR Phase II to achieve commercialization. NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) may allow small businesses who have been awarded a Phase II SBIR or STTR to submit a Phase IIB (second, sequential Phase II) SBIR or STTR application that will provide additional funding for Phase II SBIR or STTR projects. These renewals are typically offered for those projects that require extraordinary time and effort, including those requiring regulatory approval or developing complex instrumentation, clinical research tools, and behavioral interventions. Commercial potential (i.e. the probability that an application will result in a commercial product) will be strongly considered in review (refer to Section V. Application Review Information) and making funding decisions. An applicant's ability to secure substantial independent third-party investor funds will help validate the commercial potential of the proposed Phase IIB project. Applicants are encouraged to secure substantial independent third-part investor funds (i.e., third-party funds that equal or exceed the requested NIH funds). Examples of third-party investors include, but are not limited to, another company, a venture capital firm, an angel investor, a foundation, a university, a research institution, a State or local government, or any combination of the above. Applicants must provide a commercialization plan that describes the long-term commercialization strategy and details of any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or will be provided during the Phase IIB project period. If applicable, the application should include letters of support from third-party investors. NIH ICs that accept Phase IIB applications, either through this SBIR NOFOs or other specific NOFOs, are listed in the current SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA. Additional requirements and instructions (e.g., submission of a letter of intent) are available in the specific IC research topics section and in the NIH Targeted Funding Opportunities that allow Phase IIB applications.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\nThe SBIR/STTR Program Descriptions and Research Topics for NIH, CDC, and FDA represent scientific program areas that may be of interest to applicant smal...",

                "topic_description": "Purpose\n\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages the translation of technology and therapeutic innovations from academic and other non-profit research sectors to the marketplace to advance the development of diagnostic and prevention tools or treatments for musculoskeletal, rheumatic, or skin diseases. Small Business Concerns (SBCs) are encouraged to apply for this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant award to support late-stage translation of their work and move the lab technologies towards commercial dissemination. Applications to this FOA must describe partnerships and close collaboration between the original developers of these technologies and SBCs, which may be accomplished in a number of ways, including the use of multiple Program Directors/Principal Investigators and/or employing researchers from the original institutions in the SBCs.\n\nThe NIAMS/NIH and other research sponsors have invested a significant amount of funds in developing new technologies to study musculoskeletal, rheumatic, and skin diseases from basic, translational, and clinical perspectives through a variety of mechanisms, such as the NIH R01, R15, R21, R61, and P50, as well as NIH Research Evaluation and Commercialization Hub (REACH) Awards. These investments have produced a large amount of intellectual property for new technologies including drug candidates, biomarkers, diagnostic tools, and tissue engineering products. Since commercialization of a new technology or a potentially new therapeutic is a complex process, academic investigators with a focus on theoretical and mechanistic studies may not have the capacity to translate lab technology concepts into products for clinical use. Consequently, these concepts for new technologies and drugs may slowly or never advance to commercial dissemination. This FOA is intended to utilize the NIH SBIR grant mechanism to move these innovations in NIAMS mission-relevant research from non-commercial laboratories into the commercial marketplace through collaborations between small businesses and non-commercial laboratories.\n\nResearch Objectives and Scope\n\nThis initiative will support late-stage pre-clinical studies on technology or therapy feasibility, and studies that are required for regulatory approval before clinical testing and making new lab technologies more practical for clinical use. Applications may include human subjects research; however, clinical trials are excluded. Applicants could propose to analyze samples from affected subjects and controls, conduct subject interviews, or other procedures of clinical research.\n\nFor the purpose of this initiative, a late-stage translation is the continuation of previous research work that has shown promising data for development of a product. It is expected that the academic/non-profit labs have conducted mechanistic studies and obtained preliminary results that provide a strong premise to further develop the technology or therapy. The concept of a product should be well defined.\n\nNIAMS mission-relevant research topics include, but are not limited to:\n\nDevelopment of therapies such as drugs, biologics, devices, cells, genes or behavioral interventions\n\nDevelopment of innovative strategies for the delivery of drugs\n\nBiomarker studies focusing on changes in disease-associated biochemistry, imaging, physiology, or other measures that would facilitate screening and diagnosis\n\nDevelopment of outcome measures and methodologies that would enhance future observational studies and clinical trials\n\nDevelopment of 3D human tissue models for studying pathogenesis and/or testing new therapeutics\n\nCollaboration Between Academic/Non-profit Lab and SBCs\n\nCommercialization of academic/non-profit lab research results is normally supported by the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, in which the research institutions can significantly contribute to the research and development. This FOA specifically encourages late-stage translation to be completed mostly by the small businesses. A collaboration between academic/non-profit labs and SBCs is encouraged, and the academic/non-profit lab can perform a portion of the project in accordance with the SBIR policy. This initiative also encourages academic researchers to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship. A technology transfer agreement between the research institution and the SBC should be in place.\n\nMilestones\n\nNIH emphasizes rigor and reproducibility of observed results. This FOA will support duplication of the critical experiments/tests in a new setting (e.g., a different device model, a 3D human tissue model) to demonstrate the feasibility of a technology for commercialization or to support FDA approval for clinical trial. Because development of a new technology or therapy is inherently high-risk, attrition is anticipated as projects move through the process. To help mitigate this risk, applications must propose one or more milestones associated with each of the research plan's objectives in each phase of the project. Milestones are goals that measure success and/or efficacy that can be used for go/no-go decision-making for the project, and should have quantitative success criteria and an associated rationale for each. Quantitative criteria should be robust and consistent with the state-of-the-art of the field. Details on methods, assumptions, experimental designs, and data analysis plans (if the results are quantitatively measured) should be included for each milestone. Each milestone must have a timeline and be incorporated into the overall project timeline, which should also be reflected in a Gantt chart.\n\nApplications Not Responsive to This FOA\n\nExamples of research that are not responsive to this FOA include:\n\napplications that propose research and development that is not originated from an academic/non-profit lab\napplications that propose to conduct intervention studies\nNon-responsive applications will be returned without review....",
